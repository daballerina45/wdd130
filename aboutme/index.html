<h2>Kayla Chantel Meckle</h2>
    <p>Dancer. Friend. Musician.</p>       
    <p>Hello, my name is Kayla Meckle. I was born in Cape Coral, Florida, but was adopted in Spokane, WA, which is where I currently live. I am single, but live with my best friend and her daughter. </p>
    <p>One thing that I love doing is dancing! Below is a photo from my dance studio's production of Peter Pan that we did this last June. I love dance with my whole heart. This semester at my studio, Jubilee Dance, I am taking ballet, contemporary, hiphop, private lyrical/ballet lessons, and our very own outreach company, Awestruck! I even have an Instagram that's devoted to my dancing! It is my favorite thing to fill my time with and something that I see myself doing someday to teach others about dance in my own studio. It's even better that our studio is so welcoming and is Christian based. Our motto is "For the joy of it!" and our mission statement is all about providing encouraging, non-competitive, body-positive, and Christ-centered dance opportunities for all that aim to bring glory to God. This studio has helped me see how we can use movement to glorify God and it so special to me.</p>
<p>I am in my first semester of studying the web development program. I'm super excited to learn all about writing programs and it will keep things interesting at the very least. This is a step in the direction of being able to work from home, while I pursue becoming a dance studio owner.</p>
